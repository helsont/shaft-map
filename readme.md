Shaft Map, V1

SVG Map project for The Shaft at spectrum.columbiaspectator.com
An interactive guide to Columbia's housing options, complete with filtering options for amenities.
Currently live at http://spectrum.columbiaspectator.com/shaft_map

Map created previously in Adobe Illustrator by Spec Graphic Design, exported and cleaned up to web-safe svg

Using modernizr, jquery, svgpan, will be refactored using angular.js and underscore.js (maybe some new D3 features?) for V2

Thanks Smita, Sneha, and Isaac for contributing!
