Shaft Map, V1

SVG Map project for The Shaft blog for Columbia Daily Spectator. 
An interactive guide to Columbia's housing options, complete with filtering options for amenities.
Click on a building name and find a description, cutoff numbers, and list of amenities. The building color on the map changes to orange to highlight the location on campus. 

Currently live at http://columbiaspectator.com/shaft_map/

Map created previously in Adobe Illustrator by Spec Graphic Design, exported and cleaned up to web-safe svg. Tagged shapes with Ids to make them interactive/stylable using css.

Using modernizr, jquery, svgpan. Will be refactored using angular.js and underscore.js (maybe some new D3 features?) for V2.

Thanks Smita, Sneha, Isaac, and the Spectrum staff for contributing!
