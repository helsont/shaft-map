Shaft Map, V1

SVG Map project for The Shaft blog for Columbia Daily Spectator
An interactive guide to Columbia's housing options, complete with filtering options for amenities.
Currently live at http://spectrum.columbiaspectator.com/shaft_map

Map created previously in Adobe Illustrator by Spec Graphic Design, exported and cleaned up to web-safe svg

Using modernizr, jquery, svgpan. Will be refactored using angular.js and underscore.js (maybe some new D3 features?) for V2.

Thanks Smita, Sneha, and Isaac for contributing!
